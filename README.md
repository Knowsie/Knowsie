# Knowsie
*CS499 Team Project: Kelly Nguyen & Eric Cao*

## The Problem
Currently, there are a plethora of social media applications; and it’s making it hard to keep track of the people you care about. Staying in touch with family, friends, and celebrities becomes a tedious and repetitive task. You have to open each individual social media app, search that person, and view their profile to see if any changes have occurred.

## Concept
Knowsie is an Android app designed to help you keep track of important individuals in your life. The concept is simple: declare which usernames you would like to monitor, group them accordingly, and get real-time push notifications directly to your phone whenever that user makes updates to their social media page.

## Scope
Knowsie will support 3 social media sites: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Users can choose the social media, enter the specific username they would like to monitor, and decide to group them with other users if desired (i.e. Family, Celebrities, Significant Other). Our application will also support user registration, modify/delete groups, and push notifications.
